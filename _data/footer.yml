# To add a new link to the footer, follow these steps:
# 1. Identify the section where you want to add the link.
# 2. Under the children of the identified section, add a new entry.
# 3. Each entry should have the following fields:
#    - title: The name of the entry.
#    - url: The URL that the entry should link to.
#    - newpage: If the entry should open in a new page, set this to true.
# 4. You can create new sections if needed. For this you may need to specify a title and children array.
